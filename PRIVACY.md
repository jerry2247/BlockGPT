# BlockGPT Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 15, 2026

## What BlockGPT Does

BlockGPT is a Chrome extension that removes sponsored ads, upgrade banners, and ad disclaimers from ChatGPT.

## Data We Collect

When the extension blocks a sponsored ad, it sends the following anonymous data to our server:

- **Advertiser/sponsor name** (e.g., "Canva") — the name displayed in the blocked ad
- **Timestamp** — when the ad was blocked
- **Random installation ID** — a randomly generated UUID assigned to each installation, not linked to any account or identity
- **Extension version number**

That is all. We do not collect:

- Names, email addresses, or any personal information
- Browsing history or page content
- ChatGPT conversations or prompts
- IP addresses (only a one-way hash is stored for rate limiting — it cannot be reversed to reveal your actual IP)
- Cookies, authentication tokens, or account data

## Why We Collect This Data

To understand which advertisers are most frequently shown on ChatGPT and how ad volume changes over time. This helps us improve the extension and share insights about advertising trends on AI platforms.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your data with any third parties.

## Data Storage

Data is stored on Supabase (hosted on AWS). The anonymous block events are retained indefinitely for aggregate analysis. Since no personal information is collected, the stored data cannot be linked back to any individual user.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personally identifiable information, there is no personal data to request, modify, or delete. If you uninstall the extension, it stops sending data immediately. Your random installation ID is discarded and cannot be traced to you.

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this policy, we will update the "Last updated" date above.
